# RJM-local-search-alg
Assignment to implement local search algorithms on an RJM board

The purpose of this assignment was to create an RJM board where you could find a path from all the squares to a certain
number of squares in the most number of steps. The square would have the number of steps you can move either left or down. 
The player jumps from square to square until they reach the goal step.
